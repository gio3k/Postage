# Postage
Experimental s&amp;box reimplemented launcher / bootstrap

## Usage
```
Please note that Postage is in development and might not even work at all.
```
1. Compile the solution - you might need to fix references, you also need Harmony and CommandLineParser
2. Run `Postage.Launcher.exe --root (path to sbox) --apx (anything, unimplemented) --app (anything, unimplemented)`
